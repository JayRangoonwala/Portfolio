        Hey there! I'm <strong className="font-bold max-md:text-xs text-base text-slate-300">Jay M. Rangoonwala</strong>, a passionate <strong className="font-bold text-base max-md:text-xs text-slate-300">Web Developer</strong>
        💻 with expertise in <strong className="font-bold text-base max-md:text-xs text-slate-200"> React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB⚡</strong>. Currently,
        I'm a pre-final year Computer Engineering student 🎓 at Sarvajanik
        College of Engineering and Technology, where I love turning ideas into
        scalable and efficient web applications. <br /><br /> My journey began with frontend
        development 🎨, but my curiosity led me deep into backend engineering
        🛠️. Now, I specialize in building <strong className="font-bold text-base max-md:text-xs text-slate-300"> RESTful APIs, optimizing databases,
        and developing secure authentication systems.</strong> I enjoy crafting seamless
        dashboards, expense trackers, and interactive applications that provide
        real-world solutions. <br /><br /> Beyond web development, I'm exploring <strong className="font-bold text-base max-md:text-xs text-slate-300">Machine
        Learning 🤖 and Blockchain 🔗</strong>, always pushing myself to stay
        ahead in the tech world. I believe in continuous learning and constantly
        work on refining my skills through real-world projects and hands-on
        experience. Outside of coding, you’ll often find me at the <strong className="font-bold text-lg max-md:text-xs text-slate-300"> Gym 🏋️,</strong>
        focusing on self-discipline, strength training, and personal growth.
        <br /><br /> Let's connect and build something extraordinary together! 🚀✨
